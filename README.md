# My RStudio experiments 

## Welcome

Welcome to this repo! This space contains additional analytics and experiments with RStudio, occasionally using Copilot and GPT-4o mini. This includes -
1. Solving Math puzzles in R; see here for the post on [rworks](https://rworks.dev/posts/math-puzzles/)
2. Data visualization & analytics workflows; see here for the [post](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2017/08/14/end-to-end-visualization-using-ggplot2/)
3. SQL & tidyverse together in RStudio; see here for the [post](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2023/04/06/a-data-analyst-workflow-part-1-sql-tidyverse/)

At the moment, this repo contains only the original Quarto or Markdown files used to create the posts. Additional code chunks will be posted soon.
